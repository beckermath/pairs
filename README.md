# pairs
non-sensical card game where you lay down cards, replacing pairs with new cards until you either reach 8 cards with no pairs left and lose or get through the whole deck and win.

While bored at a party, my friend Sam showed me this simple card game you play by yourself. Your success completley depends on your luck with the shuffled deck. You lay down up to 8 cards in a 2x4 grid, covering any two cards in the grid that create a pair. If at any point you cannot lay down cards, the situation being you have a full grid with no pairs, you lose. Make it through the whole deck and you win. Its difficult.
